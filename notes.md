<H1> Notes </H1>
<p> Listened to the weekly podcast and did the readings. </p> 
<H3> REGEX </H3>
<p> I read the whole post of REGEX. When trying it out I had some problems with the ‘curl’ command where it was creating an empty text document. After looking at the discord I found that the solution was to use the windows command prompt instead of Anaconda PowerShell. Oops. </p> 
<p> Trimmed all the unnecessary lines, I think. I had a lot left over after performing the trims stated in the instructions, so I deleted all the “digitised by google” parts.  </p> 
<p> I finished up separating everything into the three columns and fixing the lines with too many commas. I’m worried I way have trimmed too much, or not enough. When the prof mentioned line numbers in his instructions, they didn’t line up exactly for me, I hope that doesn’t cause trouble going forward. </p> 
<H3> OpenRefine </H3> 
<p> I imputed my data into OpenRefine. After separating the sender and receiver columns into facets I realized I still had a bunch of rows to delete. I went back to REGEX and deleted more of them, then plugged the data back into OpenRefine. </p>
<p> After playing around with all the search values I was able to cluster and merge a lot of data. I found the whole process very satisfying.</p> 
<H3> Networks </H3> 
<p> I wasn’t able to get the networking tool to work, I got a server error. I saw others on discord were experiencing the same thing. I’ll try again later and hope there is a solution. </p>
